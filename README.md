### 3.1 Frontend Frameworks

### Framework A: React

#### Description:

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user
interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It is known for its
component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and modularity in the
codebase.

#### Rationale:

The choice of React for our car-rental web application is driven by several
factors:

- **Community Support**: React has a vibrant community with a wide array of
  resources available, which can assist in solving problems and learning best
  practices.
- **Scalability**: React's virtual DOM and component-based structure make it
  suitable for applications that may grow in complexity over time.
- **Ease of Integration**: React can be easily integrated into existing projects
  or used as the starting point for a new application, fitting well within the
  Agile Scrum development methodology.

#### Qualitative Assessment:

- **Strengths**: React's strengths lie in its component-based architecture,
  which allows for the creation of reusable UI components. This leads to a more
  maintainable codebase and faster development times. Additionally, React's
  virtual DOM optimizes performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
- **Weaknesses**: One potential weakness is that React has a steep learning
  curve, especially for developers not familiar with its concepts like JSX and
  the component lifecycle. Moreover, React is just the view layer, meaning that
  other libraries or frameworks may be needed for state management or routing.
- **Use Cases**: Given the project's requirements, React is an excellent choice
  for implementing the core features of the car-rental application. For
  instance, the component-based architecture would allow for the creation of
  separate components for browsing vehicles, starting a reservation, and
  managing user accounts. These components could then be composed to form the
  complete application interface.
