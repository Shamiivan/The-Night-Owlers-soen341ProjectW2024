given a project description, what stack would you recomend? Objective. This
project will help you to get a taste of software project management skills
firsthand. You will follow the Agile development approach; take advantage of
GitHub distributed version control plus access control, bug tracking, software
feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis to support
your project management process. The project is divided into 4 incremental
deliveries which we refer to as sprints based on Agile Scrum methodology, which
will be used in this course.

The duration of the project is around 10 weeks; the development process is an
adapted Agile with 3 to 4 weeks long iterations, 4 iterations in total. The
first 2 weeks of the first sprint are for training and setting up your
development environment.

Because of the short span of this project, you are not expected to deliver a
marketable product, but the result should be at least a compelling
middle-fidelity prototype that could serve as the basis for building a real
product. Check these two links on prototype fidelity quite helpful: A Guide to

Description. A car rental application is a software platform designed to
facilitate the process of renting vehicles for short periods, typically ranging
from a few hours to a few weeks. The application serves as an interface between
customers looking to rent vehicles and the car rental company offering those
services.

We three identify primary users: Customers, Customer service representatives
(CSR), and system administrator(s).

List of main use cases organized by user type.

Customer Browse vehicles for rent: A catalog of rental vehicles Start a
reservation: After providing a location (postal code, city, or airport) and a
pickup and return date, the customer will be shown vehicles that match the
specific criteria such as type (CARs, SUVs, Vans, Trucks) category (compact,
standard, intermediate, etc.), and price range. During the reservation, a
customer can add extra equipment at an additional price View/Modify/Cancel
reservation Find a branch: The customer provides a postal code or Airport to
find the nearest branch Rating and review: Customers can provide feedback and
ratings for the rented vehicles and overall rental experience. Customer service
representative Check-in process for customers with or without reservation if the
customer did not make a reservation, he creates a new reservation in the system
if the customer has made a reservation, he confirms the reservation in the
system by verifying the customer’s reservation, and customer identification;
then, it proceeds to the rental agreement review and payment processing.
Check-out process. After physically inspecting the vehicle, the CSR reviews the
rental agreement ensuring that the terms and conditions of the rental are met;
processes the final billing based on the rental duration, additional services,
and any applicable fee; performs the payment settlement and confirms the
completion of the return process in the system.\
System administrator CRUD operations on vehicles CRUD operations on user
accounts CRUD operations on reservations

This is not an exhaustive list of features/users. Other kinds of users and
features could be considered. Your project grade criteria consider originality
and innovation. The highest marks will be given to teams who are thinking out of
the box and include other relevant users and functionalities for eventual
implementation when properly justified.

For the first sprint, you have to consider the following core features: Start a
